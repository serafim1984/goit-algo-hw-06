# Graph G

shows schema of central stations of Kyiv metro.

## BFS algorithm

goes from central station to each branch station in iteration in circles.
so first fisited central stations, then one closest station on each branch and them next closest station on each branch.

## DFS algorithm

goes from central station to each station on specific branch and direction.
and only after finishing with specific branch and direction goes to next branch

## Graph analysis

According all centrality metrics central stations more "important" then others and closest to central stations more important than farest.
